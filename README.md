<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

QueueByt is a Discord bot specifically engineered to streamline the process of scrim registration and tournament booking within competitive gaming communities. Designed for automation and operational efficiency, QueueByt eliminates the need for manual coordination by providing a centralized, intuitive interface for scheduling matches, managing team registrations, and organizing tournament brackets.

QueueByt functions as an infrastructure tool that integrates seamlessly with Discord servers, offering customizable queue systems, automated match pairing, and real-time registration tracking. The bot is particularly suited for esports organizations, gaming leagues, and community managers seeking to reduce administrative overhead and enhance the participant experience.

Key features typically include:

* Automated Scrim Scheduling: Enables teams to join or create scrim queues based on game titles, ranks, or availability.
* Tournament Booking Tools: Facilitates event registration, match generation, and bracket progression without requiring external platforms.
* Role & Permission Integration: Ensures that user access and actions are governed by server roles, preserving order and security.
* Real-Time Notifications: Provides timely alerts for upcoming matches, registration deadlines, and match confirmations.
* Admin Dashboard or Commands: Offers moderators and organizers granular control over queues, time slots, and participant data.

Overall, QueueByt serves as a scalable solution for competitive ecosystems aiming to foster organized, fair, and efficient gameplay environments within Discord.

## Prerequisites

1. Discord Account with Appropriate Permissions
    * You must have the “Manage Server” permission in the Discord server where you want to add QueueByt. This permission is necessary to authorize and configure the bot properly.
2. Essential Bot Permissions
    * When adding QueueByt via the invite link, ensure you grant the following permissions:
   ```
      - Manage Roles – to assign and manage user roles related to queues and tournaments.
      - Send Messages – for the bot to communicate in designated channels.
      - Use Slash Commands – to allow interaction through slash commands like /setup and /help.
      - Other permissions included in the invite will be requested automatically. 
      - Avoid removing any essential permissions after installation.
   ```
3. Server Environment
    * Avoid adding QueueByt to unmoderated servers or NSFW (Not Safe For Work) channels, as this may cause functionality restrictions or unexpected behavior.
    * The server should ideally have a clear structure for roles and channels to facilitate queue and tournament management.
4. Discord Client
    * A Discord client capable of using slash commands (Discord desktop app, browser version, or mobile app with updated features).

## Installation

Follow these steps to correctly install QueueByt in your Discord server:

1. Prerequisite Checks
    * Ensure you have the “Manage Server” permission in the Discord server where you want to install QueueByt.
    * Confirm you can configure roles and channels as needed for bot setup.

2. Add QueueByt to Your Server [https://QueueByt.com](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1396962875523858452&scope=applications.commands%20bot&permissions=536737213566)
    * When prompted, approve all required permissions, including:
    ```
      - Manage Roles
      - Send Messages
      - Use Slash Commands
   ```
    * Do not remove or modify these permissions after installation; this ensures full functionality.
3. Configure QueueByt
    * In a channel where the bot has access, type /setup and follow the prompts to:
    ```
      - Assign channels for queue and tournament activities
      - Set up roles for participants and admins
    ```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Adhering to these guidelines will help your community get the most out of QueueByt, ensuring smooth operation and a positive experience for all participants.

1.  Use Official QueueByt Only - Always use the authentic, unmodified version of QueueByt. Avoid running unauthorized, altered, or self-hosted copies to ensure reliability and access to support.

2.  Appropriate Server Use - QueueByt should be operated in moderated, gaming-focused Discord servers. Do not add it to NSFW or unmoderated servers; misuse may result in restricted functionality or removal.

3.  Maintain Required Permissions - Do not remove or downgrade key permissions after installation.

4.  Role Hierarchy - Ensure QueueByt’s role is placed above any participant/admin roles it needs to manage. This is vital for assigning or modifying user roles within tournaments and scrims.

5.  Channel Access - Only use QueueByt in channels where it has sufficient permissions to send messages, view messages, and manage queues.

6.  Accurate Registration - Instruct teams and participants to register through official queue or tournament channels, following prompts provided by the bot.

7.  Monitor Notifications - Advise all users to monitor server notifications for match pairings, scheduling updates, and registration deadlines.

8.  Dispute Resolution - Direct any disputes, errors, or match issues to server moderators or use designated support channels.

9.  Protect Sensitive Operations - Restrict administrative commands to trusted roles only. Never share sensitive permissions with untrusted users.

10. Access Official Help - For technical difficulties or advanced setup, join QueueByt’s official support server or consult the [Documentation](https://github.com/MRBYT/QueueByt/blob/main/README.md)_
